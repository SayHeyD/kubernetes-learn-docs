# MongoDB and MongoExpress example

In this example we are going to setup a service with kubernetes that will provide a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) service and a [MongoExpress](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express) service that we can access from our client.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a NoSQL Database and [MongoExpress](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express) is a admin interface for MongoDB written in Node.js.
